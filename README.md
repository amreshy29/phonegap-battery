# PhoneGap Battery Events Demo

Simple battery events demo, currently based on old PhoneGap 2.9.0.

Tested on four different devices and Android versions:

- Samsung Galaxy Nexus with Android 4.3 (previously Android 4.2.2),
- LG GT540 with Android 2.3.3 and CyanogenMod, 
- GSmart Rola G1317D with Android 2.2.2,
- Sony Xperia E with Android 4.1.1.

All seems to be fine, after implementing [this small fix](https://github.com/phonegap/build/issues/178#issuecomment-24287410).

Tested **only** as compiled through [PhoneGap Build](http://build.phonegap.com). Never compiled locally or tested after such build.
